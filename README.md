This repository contains performance testing scripts for the Demoblaze e-commerce website. The objective of the project is to evaluate the website's performance through load testing and spike testing. The testing covers a typical end-to-end (E2E) user scenario, starting from signing up to logging out.

Overview
The project includes the following performance testing activities:

1- Load Testing:
	  The load testing simulates real-user activity on the website and checks its performance under normal conditions.
    The scenario includes the following steps:
    Sign up for a new user account.
    Log in to the user account.
    Select a product category.
    Select an item from the category.
    Add the item to the shopping cart.
    Place an order.
    Log out of the account.


2- Spike Testing:
    The spike testing targets the "Add to Cart" page to analyze how the website performs under sudden and extreme load.
    This test simulates a rapid increase in user activity to assess the website's ability to handle a sudden influx of users.
